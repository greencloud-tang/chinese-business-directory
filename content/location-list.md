## Search Tips
1. The Chinese characters in this list are the same as what they appear in the original source, i.e. Tradtional Chinese characters. However, there is a small amount of variant characters (eg. 賛 instead of 讚). If a search of a Chinese transliteration returns no result, try searching part of the transliteration, or try searching character by character.

2. Using the search boxes

* Global search box (above the table): put in your search term here to search the table across all columns. 

* Column filter box: click at the box to select a value from a dropdown list. Or use the filter box to further narrow down the results after a global search. 

* Use the "Clear All" to clear the search (global search and column filters). 

* Use the "x" on the right of a filter box to clear the filter.
