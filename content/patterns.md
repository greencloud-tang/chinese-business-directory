Through an analysis of the data for the United States and Canada extracted from International Chinese Business Directory of the World (Wong, 1913), some patterns are identified about the Chinese transliteration of place names by early Chinese immmigrants in the early 1900s. 

### 1. Transliteration approaches
The majority of the place names were transliterated, replaced with
approximate phonetic equivalents in Cantonese dialects. For example: 阿兵尼埠 (Albany), 波地磨埠 (Baltimore). 

A hybrid approach (transliteration and translation) is adopted for some place names, especially those with "New", "North", "South" in the name. For example: 北卡路連拿省 (North Carolina), 新墨西哥省 (New Mexico).

A third approach is to use a distinctive feature of the place as its Chinese term, or part of the Chinese term. For example: Honolulu is transliterated as 檀香山正埠 because Hawaii was well known in China for its sandalwood. Lafayette is named 罅啡盆地埠. While 罅啡 is the transliteration, 盆地 (basin) came from the nearby Atchafalaya Basin. 

### 2. Arbitrary transliteration
No standardization of the Chinese transliteration of place names could be identified from the data, although some transliterations repeatedly appeared (see the list on the right). The transliteration is mostly arbitrary. The same place name could be transliterated into different Chinese characters, because the same English phoneme could be approximated with different Chinese characters with the same sound, and different Chinese dialect speakers could use different characters to approximate the same sound. 

The early Chinese immigrants to the United States and Canada primarily came from the southern coastal province of Guangdong, in particular from four adjacent villages of Sun-wui (Xinhui),  Hoi-ping (Kaiping), Toi-san (Taishan) and Yin-ping (Enping), which are commonly known as “Four Districts”. Cantonese or variations of Cantonese was the dominant Chinese dialect spoken among early Chinese immigrants in Canada. 

Based on the analysis of the data, the place names compiled in the directory (Wong, 1913) were mainly transliterated by Toishanese and Cantonese speakers.  

Examples of same phonemes approximated with different Chinese characters

### 3. Challenges to correctly identify the Enlgish place names from the transliterations

When the Chinese transliteration of American and Canadian place names are found on the Chinese community newspapers, correspondence and secondary sources, it could be challenging to correct identify their corresponding place names in English, even with proficency in Cantonese and Toishanese dialects. 

#### 3.1. Wrong pronunciation for various reasons. 
During the analyis of the data, some transliterations are hard to accounted for, as neither the Toishanese nor Cantonese pronunciation seem to appromimate the English phoneme. Some examples are below. 

An assumption could be made that, the person who first translaterated the place name did not pronounce the English place name correctly. The early Chinese immigrants to the United States and Cananda primarily came from villages in the "Four Districts" with little formal education. It is reasonable to assume that they learned the pronunciation of the English place names by hearing others pronoucing them. As countries of immirants, many place names in the United States and Canada may be pronounced differently by different immigrant communities, especially indigenous place names. 

| Place Name       	| IPA            	| Transliteration 	| Note                                	|
|--------------	|-----------------	|--------------------|---------------------------------------	|
| Quesnel      	| kwəˈnɛl        	| 改市尼埠        	| silent "s" approximated by 市       	|
| Clayoquat    	| ˈklækwɒt       	| 企李島括埠      	| silent "o" approximated by 島       	|
| Whitefish    	| ˈwaɪtˌfɪʃ      	| 渴非市埠        	| "wh" approximated by 渴 (hɔt)       	|
| Attleboro    	| ˈætəlbəroʊ     	| 的罅布路埠      	| "ttle" approximated by 罅 (la)      	|
| Mojave       	| moʊˈhɑvi       	| 務爪偉          	| "ja" approximated by 爪 (jau)       	|
| Kahului      	| kəˈhulwi       	| 加口藟埠        	| "lui" approximated by 藟 (lui)      	|
| Nova Scotia  	| ˈnoʊvə ˈskoʊʃə 	| 那華市哥地省    	| "tia" approximated by 地 (di)       	|
| Peterborough 	| ˈpitərbəroʊ    	| 彼得布路付埠    	| silent "gh" approximated by 付 (fu) 	|

#### 3.2. Syllable ommisons/additions in the transliteration

When the place name only contains one syllable, one or two additional Chinese characters were added to the transliteration to make it sound more like a Chinese place name. For example: Lynn 阿連埠, Butte 猫失地埠 (失地=City). Sometimes the transliteration could be shortened with phonetic omissions, espcially if the place name is long. For example, Philadelphia 費城埠, Los Angeles 羅生埠. Guadalupe 和老比埠, Hueneme 懷念埠.

#### 3.3. Confusion with other place names

The following transliterations are apparently not the phonectic approximation of its English place names.

| Place Name 	| Transliteration 	| Note                             	|
|------------	|-----------------	|----------------------------------	|
| Florida    	| 咈囉稜斯省      	| Confused with "Florence"?        	|
| Manitoba   	| 穩尼辟省        	| Confused with "Winnipeg"?        	|
| Salmon     	| 所羅門埠        	| Confused with "Solomon Islands"? 	|

#### 3.4. Approximation of the "r" and the syllable-final "l" sound
The English "r" sound is absent in either Toishanese or Cantonese. When the consonant is put at the syllable-initial position, it is often substituted with the "l" sound, as can be seen in the following examples.

| Place Name 	| Transliteration 	| Note             	|
|------------	|----------------	|------------------	|
| Arizona    	| 亞利笋拿省       	| "ri" = 利 /li/  	|
| Colorado   	| 哥羅拉多省      	| "ra" = 拉 /la/   	|
| Eureka     	| 夭李架埠        	| "re" = 李 /li/  	|
| Lawrence   	| 老崙埠          	| "ren" = 崙 /lun/ 	|

In Cantonese or Toishaniese, the ‘l’ sound is absent at the syllable-final position. In such cases, the "l" sound is often approximated by a Chinese character with a syllable-initial "l" sound, as can be seen by the examples below. 

| Place Name  	| Transliteration 	| Note                  	|
|-------------	|-----------------	|-----------------------	|
| Barkerville 	| 百架委利埠      	| "ville" = 委利 /vili/ 	|
| Lowell      	| 羅委路埠        	| "well" = 委路 /vilu/  	|
| Wells       	| 委路市埠        	| "well" = 委路 /vilu/  	|
| Elko        	| 埃路高埠        	| "el" = 埃路 /ailu/    	|
| Fall River  	| 伙路笠罷埠      	| "fall" = 伙路 /fɔlu/  	|
