## About the Project

This project utilized the Google Gemini API within a Python script to process a digitized directory of early 20th-century global Chinese businesses (Wong, 1913). The API performed Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the traditional Chinese text within the PDF, extracting key business information. This extracted data was then analyzed and visualized to unveil findings revealing: 

1. the geographical distribution of these businesses, displayed on an interactive world map; 
2. the predominant business categories engaged in by overseas Chinese, displayed on a wordcloud; 
3. linguistic patterns evident in the transliteration of local place names into Chinese, offering insight into early immigrant experiences and language adaptation. 

This methodology demonstrates the power of combining modern AI tools with historical sources to uncover hidden historical patterns.

## How to use this site

From the top menu, you may select "Directory", "Location List" or "Patterns" page for the following purposes. 

1. The [Directory](https://greencloud-tang.github.io/chinese-business-directory/directory/) contains the data extracted from the digitized International Chinese Business Directory of the World (Wong, 1913). At this moment, data for Chinese businesses outside China is available. Data for Chinese businesses within China will be added when they are processed. 

    - There are two data visualizations alongside with this data table, an interactive map showing the geographical distribution of the businesses, and a wordcloud showing the business sectors. 

2. The [Location List](https://greencloud-tang.github.io/chinese-business-directory/location-list/) contains a list of place names of the Americas with Chinese transliterations sourced from the above directory and a few other sources. 

3. The [Patterns](https://greencloud-tang.github.io/chinese-business-directory/patterns/) contains patterns of the Chinese transliteration of place names by early Chinese immmigrants in Canada and the United States in the early 1900s, identified from an analysis of the data extracted from the International Chinese Business Directory of the World (Wong, 1913).
